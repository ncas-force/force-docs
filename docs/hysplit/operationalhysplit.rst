====================================
Daily Operational HYSPLIT Model Runs
====================================

Daily HYSPLIT back trajectories are generated by the FORCE team for Cape Verde (CVAO), BT Tower (BTAO), and Weybourne (WAO) observatories, with a fourth run combining all three for comparative analysis. These runs provide crucial contextual information for observatory data interpretation.

-------------
Setup Summary
-------------

Daily, as part of our operational workflow, the following HYSPLIT back trajectory procedures are carried out:

**1. Configuration:**

* Simple setup control files are configured from a template file for each of the three observatories CVAO, BTAO, WAO and the combined run.
* The control files are configured for backward trajectory calculations for 240 hours (10 days).

**2. Parallel Execution:**

* Each observatory and the combined run is set up as its own instance, with a dedicated directory for its control and template files.
* These instances are then run in parallel across the cluster.

**3. Post-Processing:**

* `trajplot` is used to produce postscript (.ps) files from the model output.
* The postscript files are then converted to PNG (.png) files using `pstopng`.
* The images are renamed in the format `observatoryname_YYMMDDHH.png`.
* The images are transferred to the NCAS observations group workspace (GWS) in a dated directory.

**4. Data Archiving:**

* The model outputs data to small text files.
* These text files are also useful for analysis and are uploaded to the GWS.

Setup Details on the Thundercat Cluster
---------------------------------------

**1. User:**

* A specific user account (`force-hysplit-iceland`) is set up on the cluster to run the HYSPLIT model.

**2. Directory Structure:**

* This user account has multiple HYSPLIT configurations for various projects.
* The AMOF Observatory model runs are located in the `hysplit-nwr-runs` directory.
* Within this directory, there are folders for `cape_verde`, `weybourne`, `bttower`, and `observatories`.
* Each of these folders contains a specific template file for that location and the release heights for that case.

**3. Control Files:**

* The control files are configured for each observatory and the combined run.
* The basic structure of these files is very similar, with the main differences being the starting location and the release heights.
* This is an example control file for the Cape Verde Observatory for the 18:00 on the 25th of March 2025::

Breakdown of the control file:

* The starting time is set to 25th March 2012 at 18:00.
* There are three starting locations, each with a different height.
* The total run time is set to 240 hours (10 days).
* The vertical motion calculation method is set to 0.
* The top of the model domain is set to 15500 m AGL.
* Defines how many GFS input files the run is expecting to cover the 10 days run time.
* The last lines specifies the input GFS file location.
