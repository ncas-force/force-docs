Daily Operational HYSPLIT Model Runs
====================================

Daily HYSPLIT back trajectories are generated by the FORCE team for Cape Verde (CVAO), BT Tower (BTAO), and Weybourne (WAO) observatories, with a fourth run combining all three for comparative analysis. These runs provide crucial contextual information for observatory data interpretation.

Setup Summary
-------------

Daily, as part of our operational workflow, the following HYSPLIT back trajectory procedures are carried out:

**1. Configuration:**

* Simple setup control files are configured from a template file for each of the three observatories (CVAO, BTAO, WAO).
* The control files are configured for backward trajectory calculations for 240 hours (10 days).

**2. Parallel Execution:**

* Each observatory is set up as its own instance, with a dedicated directory for its control and template files.
* These instances are then run in parallel across the cluster.

**3. Post Processing:**
