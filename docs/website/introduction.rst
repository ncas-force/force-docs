Introduction to the FORCE website. 
==================================

The FORCE website is built using React, a JavaScript library designed for creating user interfaces, particularly for web applications.

One of React's key features is its component-based architecture, which makes development more modular and maintainable.

FORCE uses the Gatsby framework, which provides significant advantages in terms of performance and SEO optimisation.
