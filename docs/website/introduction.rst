Introduction to the FORCE website. 
==================================

The FORCE website is built using React, a JavaScript library designed for creating user interfaces, particularly for web applications.

One of React's key features is its component-based architecture, which makes development more modular and maintainable.

FORCE uses the Gatsby framework, which provides significant advantages in terms of performance and SEO optimisation.

To build the site clone the git repo and then run 

npx gatsby build --prefix-paths

This will build a local copy of the site in the public directory. 
Copy the contents of this site to the location on the web server (/var/www/html/directoryname)
